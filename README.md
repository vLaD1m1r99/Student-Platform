# All in one student platform
 This is a great project which is in development on and off, because it's developed only by me. If someone wants to colaborate, you can find me by email: vladastefanovic43@gmail.com
 The plan is to create one place for all students around the world (first only for Serbian Universities and Schools), where they can get, and give all the help to each others. It will be designed
 so that all clients can register their account, and then if they are only seeking for help, they can find it here from other students just like that, and if someone wants to teach some class, it will need to submit
 to review his qualifications for that perticular class.
